#Because we have so many metrics, I was thinking we could organize these queries by HOW they are retrieved instead of WHAT is retrieved

#i.e they could be /schools/metric/<metric_name>/requirement/<requirement_detail>
#Ex: /schools/metric/admission_rate/greater/.2
# or /schools/metric/state/in/<requirement_detail>
